									<h2>Design & Development of Data Background Search Model to Support Child Protection Practices in India</h2>
									<p>Oct 9, 2018  publication description , Springer</p>
									<p>This paper deals with the design and development procedures involved in child protection practices in India. To design the logical structure of the database which is the caricature of this verification system, Entity Relationship diagrams have been used and implemented. The development procedure uses open source database connectivity with the sole motive of creating a verification system which is open, robust, secure, encrypted and contains Integrity as well as referential constraints. The DBS (Data Background Search) database has been designed and developed with the primary motive of ensuring that a convict/accused who committed a serious crime against children is kept under surveillance. The convict might try to relocate. The database created, will work irrespective of the state or city the convict lives in. In the combined recruitment drive of staffs in public schools, this DBS can be implemented as a verification system to inspect the candidates. This will be beneficial for the safety of the students as well as keeping a track on the convicts.</p>

									<h2>The application of information & communication technology in education sector through assisted classroom program</h2>
									<p>May 28, 2018  publication description , IEEE Explorer</p>
									<p>The paper deals with concept of implementing Information and communication technology in the education sector for the combined benefit of teachers and students. This motive has to be achieved in a massive scale with special emphasis on rural areas. Hence, the solution obtained after an industrious set of research and development was the concept of Assisted Classroom Program. This paper defines and elucidates the concept and need of this program driven educational process. The paper also explains how this approach has the potential to uplift the current standards of education which is at present heavily dominated by conventional practices. The proposed application of Assisted Classroom program can bring about a colossal change in the quality of education, especially in the rural areas. It has the potential to help teaches and student in order to teach and learn the lessons better and via a holistic approach.</p>
