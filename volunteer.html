										<h2 id="content">Team Lead at Desire Foundation</h2>
										<p>We are all familiar with the Right To Education (RTE) Act. Here's Desire Foundation, dedicated to one of its sections — Section 12(1)(c). 'All specified category or private schools must reserve 25% of their seats for children belonging to EWS from the neighbourhood and provide them admission from Class I onwards', it states. This organization, which started its operations in the year 2014 in Bhubaneswar, has multiple projects and ventures going on. I started here as a Sales Intern on 2016 and learnt a lot of things over the years.</p>

												<h3>Adhyayan</h3>
												<p>As part of this project, we surveyed over 500 families to collect data of children belonging to the EWS. We approached private schools to admit the eligible kids for free education. A Master database has been prepared where we connect schools, slums and children, all on one platform. We provide them online education and also keep a track on their progress. We are constantly monitoring performances and hardships faced by the kids who were admitted to school under Adhyayan previously. We have admitted more than 300 kids till now.</p>

												<h3>Liter of Light</h3>
												<p>On 25th August, in Bhubaneswar, we carried out a global project in collaboration with Mr. Illac Diaz (founder
													of Liter of Light), Mr. Panjak Dixit and a few delegates from UAE. Along with Liter of
													Light, we prepared solar lanterns and solar lamps. The initiative was focused on being eco-friendly and thus
													
													most parts of the street lights were taken from waste material. Instead of metal rods, bamboo was used to install those lights. Instead of glass bottles, plastic
													
													bottles were used for lighting. Study lamps were also given to children of the village keeping in mind their ease of study at night. We also
													installed three automatic solar lights in the ward.</p>

												<h3>10000 copies sold</h3>
												<p><quote>You write and help them write</quote> is our motto. We sold close to 10000 copies in and around Bhubaneswar's colleges and the profits went to serving the kids. We also donated some of the copies to the kids admitted to private schools.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Organized donation drives</h3>
												<p>We organize many donation drives several times a year. These are mostly food donation drives but we also distribute stationary items and clothing. One such event was Treatzza, wherein we took the kids to Pizza Hut.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Collaborations</h3>
												<p>Collaborated with various other organizations, on events. Some of them were to raise awareness whereas others were fundraisers. These helped us meet new people from the social sectors, who spread the word about RTE.</p>

										<h2 id="content">ThinkZone</h2>
										<p>May 2017 - Jul 2017</p>
										<p>ThinkZone is an award winning social impact startup that enables women entrepreneurs to drive technology-based learning in low-income communities. ThinkZone implements a comprehensive, scale-driven lean model through its ‘school-in-a-box’ solution to deliver quality early childhood and primary-level education programs at less than a dollar a month per child.
											This is probably the very few times in India where a technology-based pedagogy is built for first-generation learners and for teachers who come from limited education background. 
											I worked as a content research intern.</p>
